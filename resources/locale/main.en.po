"The electromagnetic pulse missile (EMP) reproduces the disruptive effects of "
"a nuclear explosion, but without the destructive properties. This causes it "
"to only affect shields within its blast radius, leaving their hulls intact. "
"The EMP missile is also smaller and easier to store than heavy nukes. Many "
"captains (and pirates) prefer EMPs over nukes for these reasons, and use "
"them to knock out targets' shields before closing to disable them with "
"focused beam fire."
